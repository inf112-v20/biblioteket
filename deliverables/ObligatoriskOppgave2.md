# Assignment 2 - Biblioteket

# Task 1 - Project and Project Structure

## Team roles

For the first assignment, the roles worked out well. 
However for the second assignment, we had to change things up a little bit. 
Tor Kristian and Tobias weren't in Bergen for most of the assignment. Our team then made the decision that they
would share the secretary role, and do most of the written assignment together. 
Sondre, Silje and Marcus then did this assignments developing doing pair programming. 
Our team-leader, Sondre went away the 26th of February. “...” was therefore our substitute team leader during the
thursday meeting. 

Sondre and Silje will keep their roles as team-leader and customer contact. And the same for Marcus and Tobias.
However as we get further into the project and the team gets more knowledge with libGDX, 
we might not need a role as libGDX developer. 
Tor Kristian will then get a new role. 
What this role will be, will become more clear later as we will get a clearer view of what kind of role is needed. 

Team leader: Being team leader, comes with more responsibility. 
As mentioned in the previous assignment, 
Sondres main responsibility is the overall quality of our program and software implementation and 
coordination of the team. 
He assigns different tasks for each of us and makes sure everyone does what they’re supposed to. 

Customer contact: As our customer contact, Silje is responsible of ensuring that what we develop fulfills 
the provided requirements and that our own specifications and goals are met. 
She were also assigned to present the rules of the game for the rest of the group, 
and is therefore responsible of correct implementation as well as prioritizing which features to implement first other
than what is specified in the assignments. 

Secretary: Our secretary Marcus’ main responsibility is the written part of the assignments as well 
as double-checking that it fulfills the correction form to ensure that every requirement is met. 
He is also responsible of writing a transcript from each meeting. 

libGDX developer: As our libGDX developer, Tor Kristians role was to familiarize himself with libGDX, and present it
for the group in the early stages. 

Test manager: Tobias’ is our test manager, and is therefore responsible for the quality of our code by ensuring 
that each team member are developing using TDD.


## Software Development 

We chose the use of Kanban for our project, which we are still using. It provides great 
flexibility but also discipline. It also gives us a good overview of; what needs to be done, 
what the other team members are working on, and what is completed. 

We also use pair-programming when we are having in person meetings which allows for 
different opinions and might result in more efficient ways of developing as we get the chance to 
discuss while programming. 


## Group dynamics and communication

When working together as a group, it's hard to distribute the work in a way that everyone has the same 
work load. However we have handled it somewhat okay, and it have not led to any conflicts in the team.
We are working well together with the chosen methods and are trying to include everyone as much as possible. 
When disagreeing about something, everyone says their opinion, or we vote on what to do. 

The use of slack, has made communicating a lot easier. We are using our channel for discussing, questions and planning
extra meetings if necessary. Slack also makes it easier to get hold of the lecturer or group leaders if we have any 
questions regarding the assignments or something else related to the course. 


## Retrospective and improvements

Looking back at the first two assignments, we have handled things very well. With different time schedules, it's sometimes 
hard to schedule extra meetings to work together. We are trying to have an extra meeting every tuesday if necessary, 
but this doesn't always fit for all of us. Luckily the team is showing a lot of flexibility. 

During this second assignment, we did some swapping of the roles. Tor Kristian and Tobias were away 
and therefore shared the secretary role and handled the written assignment. This made it a lot easier for them to work. 
They were at home with their families, and didn't know when they had time to work. It took a lot of pressure off them
because the rest of the team weren't depending on them to have code ready at a specific time.
Also when Tor Kristian and Tobias had questions, they used the slack channel where the team replied.

Before the second assignment was out, we already had plans of what to do next. We think that staying a bit ahead, will  
only benefit us in the future assignments. If we do some developing between every assignments, 
there will be less work when the next assignments is released. Even if what we do is not a part of the next assignment, 
it will still be a part of our final product. 

Even though the team were flexible during this assignment, Tor Kristian and Tobias will have to do some developing 
in the future as it will be unfair for the rest of the team if they only do the written assignments. 

We should also improve at making sure everyone is working and committing their work to gitHub as it might look like 
someone is not contributing or contributing less to the project. It's a group project, and everyone should contribute
somewhat equally. 


## Commits 

During this assignment, Tor Kristian and Tobias will have less commits because of the teams decision to give them the 
secretary role and to the written assigment together.

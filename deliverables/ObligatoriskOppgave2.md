# Assignment 2 - Biblioteket

# Task 1 - Project and Project Structure

For the first assignment, the roles worked out well. 
However for the second assignment, we had to change things up a little bit. 
Tor Kristian and Tobias weren't in Bergen for most of the assignment. 
They therefore shared the secretary role, and did most of the written assignment together.
Sondre, Silje and Marcus then did most of the coding doing pair programming. 
Our team-leader, Sondre went away the 26th of February. “...” was therefore our substitute team leader. 

Sondre and Silje will keep their roles as team-leader and customer contact. And the same for Marcus and Tobias.
However as we get further into the project
and the team gets more knowledge with libGDX, we might not need a role as libGDX developer. 
Tor Kristian will then get a new role. 
What this role will be, will become more clear later as we will get a clearer view of what kind of role is needed. 

Team leader: Being team leader, comes with more responsibility. 
As mentioned in the previous assignment, 
Sondres main responsibility is the overall quality of our program and software implementation and 
coordination of the team. 
He assigns different tasks for each of us and makes sure everyone does what they’re supposed to. 

Customer contact: As our customer contact, Silje is responsible of ensuring that what we develop fulfills 
the provided requirements and that our own specifications and goals are met. 
She were also assigned to present the rules of the game for the rest of the group, 
and is therefore responsible of correct implementation as well as prioritizing which features to implement first other
than what is specified in the assignments. 

Secretary: Our secretary Marcus’ main responsibility is the written part of the assignments as well 
as double-checking that it fulfills the correction form to ensure that every requirement is met. 
He is also responsible of writing a transcript from each meeting. 

libGDX developer: As our libGDX developer, Tor Kristians role was to familiarize himself with libGDX, and present it
for the group in the early stages. 

Test manager: Tobias’ is our test manager, and is therefore responsible for the quality of our code by ensuring 
that each team member are developing using TDD.

We choose the use of Kanban for our project, which we are still using as it provides great 
flexibility because of different time schedules and it provides a good overview of what needs to be done, 
what the other team members are working on, and what is completed. 
We also use pair-programming when we are working together in person which allows for 
different opinions and more efficient ways of developing as we get the chance of discussing while programming.
